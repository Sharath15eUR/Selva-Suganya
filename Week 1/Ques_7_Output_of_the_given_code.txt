#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct

    char A;
    double B;
    char C;
}infoData;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    printf("\nSize of Structure = %d\n\n", sizeof(infoData));
    return 0;
}

The output of the given code is

Size of Structure = 24



Explanantion:
According to the concept of structure padding, the size of the given structure is 24.
The first char variable occupies one word in the memory and the other 3 bytes of the word are padded.
Similarly, the double variable( 8 bytes) occupies two words(4 bytes in one word * 2 = 8 bytes)
The second char variable occupies another word in which the 3 other unoccupied bytes are padded.
