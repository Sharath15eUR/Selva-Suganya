#include <stdio.h>

typedef struct
{
    int  A;
    char B;
    char C;
}infoData;

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    printf("\nSize of Structure = %d\n\n", sizeof(infoData));
    return 0;
}

// \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \   \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \

The output of the given code is

Size of Structure = 8


Explanantion:
According to the concept of structure padding, the size of the given structure is 8.
The first int variable occupies one word in the memory and the next two char variables occupy two bytes in aword leaving the other two padded.
